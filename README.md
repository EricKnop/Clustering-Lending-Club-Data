# Clustering-Lending-Club-Data
The purpose of this project is to compare two timespans, pre ipo(2012-2014) and post ipo(2015-2017). I first clustered the lending club data into 7 groups, becasue there are 7 grades given by lending club depending on the borrower, and the clusters looked stable with 7 of them. After clustering I seperated the data into two groups by timespans, and compared the two groups by looking at the mean of the important varriables along with some barplots.
